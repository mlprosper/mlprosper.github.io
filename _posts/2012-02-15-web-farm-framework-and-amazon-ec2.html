<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to take advantage of the latest Web Farm Framework from Microsoft to deploy a set of load balanced ASP.Net servers on Amazon EC2. An overview from Scott Guthrie was very helpful in getting started:</p>
<p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/09/08/introducing-the-microsoft-web-farm-framework.aspx"><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/09/08/introducing-the-microsoft-web-farm-framework.aspx">http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/09/08/introducing-the-microsoft-web-farm-framework.aspx</a></a></p>
<p>However, configuring the EC2 instances was not without a few gotchas.  For the most part, I followed a well written recipe from this site: </p>

<p>However, I had to change a few things to work for my setup.</p>
<p><strong>Security Groups</strong></p>
<p>The mebbi guide states that you need to open firewall ports publicly to get WFF to connect initially.  Since this is a small app, all my servers are all in the same Availability Zone and security group.  Granting the &#8220;Web Server&#8221; security group access to itself was good enough.  It looks like this in the Amazon Management Console:</p>

<p>You can also optionally open specific ports like it states in the mebbi guide.</p>
<p><strong>User Account Control (UAC)</strong></p>
<p>I did not have to disable UAC in order to connect between instances.  I did, however, check to make sure that a certain registry key was set as stated in this article:</p>

<p>If you are on Windows 2008R2 (and all newer EC2 instances are), Administrator accounts will not be able to access other instances by default.</p>

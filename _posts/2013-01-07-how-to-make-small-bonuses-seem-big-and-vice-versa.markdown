Thinking about giving out bonuses to your employees? Great! They probably deserve it. Now it might be hard to believe, but just giving out money won't necessarily make your employees happy. Do it right and the smallest bonus will have a great impact. Do it wrong and even the largest bonus could fall flat and cause hard feelings.

## Tell your employees

If you are handing out bonuses, for goodness sake, announce it before you give it to them. Trumpet it in a company-wide email, tell each individual in your office in person, send postcards, just do something.  Don't leave it to rumor and don't expect employees to notice.  Not everyone opens their paystub, especially salaried employees that get the same amount on every paycheck.

## Give them a separate check

A bonus is separate, special. Treat it that way.  So don't put it in the same payment as an employee's regular paycheck.  
	1. It forces to guess the amount because some paystubs aren't received in the mail until 10 days after the pay date.
	2. It creates a link between the bonus and an employee's regular salary.

Instead, send your employee's an actual check that they need to deposit. They'll have positive thoughts about the company when they tear that check from the stub, when they show it to someone, when they have to drive to the bank, and when they check their statement and see another line with extra money.


## Justify The Bonuses (Large and Small)

If your company bonuses are tied to individual or company performance, be honest and transparent about the amounts.  Even if the bonus amounts are small, most reasonable people will understand as long they feel informed by the company.

Bonuses tied to individual performance MUST be tied to a review.  If you negotiate a maximum bonus with your employees, but only hand out 75% of that amount - that's OK.  If you have a ready justification and make sure they are informed before you hand out the bonus, everything is fine. Fail to provide an explanation and even the largest bonus will be questioned. Ambiguity breeds resentment.

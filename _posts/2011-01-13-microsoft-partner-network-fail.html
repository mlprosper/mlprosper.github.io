    <p>I continue to be amazed at how certain segments of Microsoft Corporation can execute really well (Windows 7, Xbox), while other portions of the company can continually fall flat on their faces.&nbsp; The Microsoft Partner Network not only falls on its face, it falls into a steaming pile of dung of its own creation.&nbsp;&nbsp; My company purchases a yearly software subscription from MS allowing us to use products like Windows, Office, and Visual Studio at a reasonable cost for a small business.&nbsp;&nbsp; Renewing my subscription is a 4 step process.&nbsp; Simple, right?<p /> <a href='http://mlprosper.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/greenshot_2011-01-13_14-44-01.png'><img src="http://mlprosper.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/greenshot_2011-01-13_14-44-01.png?w=300" width="500" height="295" /></a>
<p />Wrong.&nbsp; During the course of this "simple assessment", I counted no less than 10 flashing (appearing and disappearing) windows on my screen.&nbsp; After the assessment (which was completely useless), I ended up with this user interface abomination:<p /> <a href='http://mlprosper.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/greenshot_2011-01-13_14-42-48-png-scaled-10001.jpg'><img src="http://mlprosper.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/greenshot_2011-01-13_14-42-48-png-scaled-10001.jpg?w=300" width="500" height="430" /></a>
<p />WTF is that window doing in the lower right corner?&nbsp; Why would I want to "Launch" the same assessment that I just completed?&nbsp; After clicking Close, I got a chance to order the software, endure another 2 pop ups, pay $500, and blow my brains out.<p /> Whoever designed the Microsoft Partner Network site should be punished by being forced to renew their Microsoft Action Pack.</p>

title: "How We Budget with Simple and Square"
---

Setting and sticking to a budget has always been hard for my family. We've tried countless tools on both web and mobile like Mint, Quicken, and even Excel. Every attempt would end in failure after a couple of weeks. We liked the principles of the cash envelope system but rejected it outright because neither my wife nor I liked carrying any cash. We also constantly racked up reward points through our credit cards. We couldn't find a system that would combine the immediate feedback of the cash system with the ease of a credit card. So we adapted our own.***

## 1. Split expenses into 2 buckets

With traditional budgeting we would always set up budgets for individual categories like Utilities, Eating Out, Cell Phone, etc. However, we could never effectively track the status of each budget and how each category affected our cash flow as a whole. We scrapped the whole thing and created 2 categories for each month:

* Things with a fixed cost every month
* Everything else

We split annual, bi-annual expenses over 12 months and added it as a line item in the first category. Yearly expenses with variable costs such as car maintenance also got split over 12 months.

The "everything else" budget became what we had left to spend on things that varied every month: groceries, eating out, gifts, kids activities, etc. THAT is how much we really had available to spend every month. We called this our "Monolithic Budget". And no, those aren't really our numbers.

## 2. Set up a bank account for the monolithic budget

Next we needed a place to store our monolithic budget dollars. We had an existing credit union bank account, but both the website and mobile app were disasters. After looking at a few different online-only banks, I picked Simple Bank because they don't have fees and the iPhone app looked killer. 

The only disadvantage was that they didn't allow joint accounts so we couldn't have one account with two cards. We did the next best thing: we opened separate Simple accounts and split the budget in two--90% for her, 10% for me. (She does all the shopping.) 

When I spend money from my Simple card I see the transaction in the app almost immediately. At the top of the app I can see exactly how much I have left to spend. 

## 3. Transfer money when needed

Every month our credit union account automatically transfers money to our Simple accounts via ACH. When we spend money on a credit card to earn points or because it shouldn't come out of our budget for some reason, we use Square Cash to reimburse our main bank account. I have an extra email address attached to our main bank account that can receive Square Cash. Transfers happen in a few minutes using Square rather than a few days using ACH.

If my wife needs to send me money for some reason (e.g. I picked up milk on the way home), she uses Simple Instant transfer in the iPhone app.

It's been several months and this is the only budgeting system that has ever stuck with us. It offers some of the same benefits as the cash envelope system while still preserving the  convenience of credit cards. To summarize:

### Advantages
1. Simplicity: We each have one budget number to track. One. 
2. Immediate feedback: each of us can see how much money we have left to spend that month __after every transaction__.
3. Flexibility: We can still use credit cards (with Square Cash to reimburse from our Simple account).

### Disadvantages
1. Set up: It takes a while to set up the budget, the accounts and the transfers.
2. Multiple accounts: 3 bank accounts to manage finances is a bit much. You can probably do this with one account if you try hard enough. Personally I like having them so separate.
3. I know *exactly* how much is in the budget, so I can't delude myself into thinking that there is more money somewhere to pay for that extra lunch out.

title: Generating an SSL cert for Amazon ELB

<p>I needed to set up a new load balancer in Amazon Web Services because my previous SSL cert had expired.  The AWS management console doesn&#8217;t allow you to enter a new SSL cert apart from setting up a new ELB.  After a little research, I found a step by step tutorial laying out how to generate a new CSR and install the certificate:</p>

<p>I have Git for Windows installed and it comes with openssl.  You can access the openssl executable here:</p>
<p>c:\Program Files (x86)\git\bin</p>
<p>When you run the commands, for some reason the files are dumped in a strange folder:</p>
<p>C:\Users\Mike\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin</p>
<p>A quick search will turn up the path where those files were dumped.</p>
<p>Here are some screenshots from an AWS post that might help too:</p>

Someone asked me for advice when hiring a contract programmer through a service like ELance or Freelancer.  I've used vWorker and had some friends who have used Elance. It's hit or  miss and really depends on the quality of the contractor. I have learned a few (hard) lessons along the way though:

1. Break your task into distinct parts and offer them as separate jobs. This helps reduce the risk if one of your contractors is a dud. The more focused your task the better.

2. Only choose workers with a spotless reputation. A firm is generally better than an individual but also more expensive.

3. Define your task down to the smallest detail. No detail is too small. Think of these workers like robots who will not stray from your specification. They do not think outside the box. If you don't specify it, they won't do it. If you tell them to do something stupid, they will do it without question.

4. Use an escrow account if the payment amount is large. Most services will offer something like this to ensure the work gets done.

5. Don't take offers outside the service. Many will want to cut out the middleman to save the fee. Don't do it - too risky.

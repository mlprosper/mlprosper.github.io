title: Visual Studio 2010 and Web Deploy ACLs

<p>Recently I&#8217;ve started using Web Deploy directly from Visual Studio 2010.  I had everything working on the staging server at one point and stupidly didn&#8217;t record the folder specific ACL changes I had made to allow IIS to serve the assets (css, images) correctly.  The first time I used Web Deploy, all the ACLs were overwritten, and my website was no longer accessible!  After some research, I found an article detailing how to prevent VS 2010 from setting the ACLs on the target automatically:</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a screenshot of the place in the project file to edit for clarity:</p>

<p>Now to figure out what the ACLs were set to originally.. Argh&#8230;</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>There’s been a lot of hoopla surrounding the release of the Google Apps iOS app with built-in navigation.  I tried it and was impressed with the overall functionality and the fact that Google is willing to release it on a platform not named “Android”.  Apple Maps does navigation just as well (except for, you know, that whole “mapping” part).</p>
<p>My friend Alex (<a href="https://twitter.com/QT1p" title="@qt1p" target="_blank">@qt1p</a>) mentioned Waze and declared it better than both. He’s right - with built-in social features that are actually useful, Waze really brings innovation to mobile navigation.</p>
<p>I decided to take Waze on my family’s annual driving trip to Southern California.  10+ stops, 2 trips diagonally across <span>Los Angeles</span><span>, 800 miles. I know this trip by heart, so the actual navigation didn’t interest me.  If I don’t use a navigation app for navigating, what value could it provide?</span></p>
<p><strong>Stacking Them Up</strong></p>
<p><span>Google and Apple Maps give you the multiple ways to get somewhere, but they’re pretty dumb. They don’t actually try to make a determination of which route would be best, they don’t tell you what kind of traffic is on the way, and they certainly don’t update you as you travel. Here’s where I really felt that Waze outperforms the big boys. </span><span>Periodically through the trip, Waze would alert me if traffic affected my route:</span></p>

<p>I could also easily recheck the route to make sure that there wasn’t another, less congested path:</p>
<p><img alt="image" height="320" src="http://media.tumblr.com/89484091d6976ec1ec64a1e49276ed2d/tumblr_inline_mftdywSmga1qjihew.jpg" width="214"/></p>
<p>Waze often selected a different primary route from Google and Apple maps (especially when traffic was present). The one time I chose to follow the Waze route it turned out to be just as accurate as any of the traditionally mapped routes.</p>
<p><strong>Social “Features”</strong></p>
<p>Most social integration in apps I’ve used consists of accessing my Facebook or Twitter account to sign in and post useless information that no one cares about. However, Waze made available to me the vast amount of information on the road other people have that would be useful to me. More importantly, they did it without being spammy or annoying. </p>
<p><img alt="image" height="320" src="http://media.tumblr.com/1cade496af76a52fc7e53a1a64dd22ce/tumblr_inline_mfte3wuwwP1qjihew.jpg" width="214"/></p>
<p>Stopped cars, weather conditions, traffic jams, police presence were all logged by other drivers and made available on my device. The information is presented by cute little icons that represent specific events. Besides being just interesting and informative in general, this type of sharing leads to a couple of cool interactions that can only happen in Waze.    On the way south we ran into a complete rainbow on the horizon. A few people posted about it, and another even snapped a photo.</p>
<p><img alt="image" height="320" src="http://media.tumblr.com/d63c30c837b4a18f992a84e8e7d6c96b/tumblr_inline_mfte7ss1HB1qjihew.jpg" width="214"/></p>
<p>During our trip, I had one of those classic “What the @#$! is going on here?” moments when the freeway slowed to a crawl.  A few moments later, someone on Waze posted an an alert <span>(I wish I had a screenshot of this)</span><span>:</span></p>
<p>“wheel fell off of a car!”</p>
<p>Instantly I felt better. I was still sitting in traffic, but that tiny bit of knowledge and perspective transformed my rage into concern. Instead of cursing under my breath, I was thinking, “Whoa, I hope they’re ok”. </p>
<p><strong>Winning the War</strong></p>
<p>Waze does a number of other things well like rankings, points, map editing, and meetups, but I didn’t pay any attention to those.  There always seemed to be at least one Waze user on the road, although there was no way to tell if they were an active user on the map. There were also a few annoying things like ad popups and too-frequent updates while I was at a stop light. While Google and Apple Maps are navigation apps, Waze can be better described as a “Navigation Assistant” due to the constant stream of useful information it provides.  Therefore, I declare Waze has won.</p>
<p><span>For now. </span></p>

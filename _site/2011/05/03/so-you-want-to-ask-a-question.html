<div class="entry-content">Recently I had a question to ask of parents of school-age children.  After talking with a couple of friends, we decided the best course of action would be to use the build-in Facebook Questions feature.  While it worked, there were some BIG gotchas that make the feature less then stellar.  I created a question with 5 options:

<a href="http://mlprosper.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/screen-shot-2011-05-03-at-10-12-05-pm.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-89" title="Screen shot 2011-05-03 at 10.12.05 PM" src="http://mlprosper.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/screen-shot-2011-05-03-at-10-12-05-pm.png" alt="" width="500" height="187" /></a>

As you can see, the display of the question is far from optimal.   First of all, why is the question truncated?  There are only 3 more words after the ellipse - why cut them off when there seems to be plenty of room to place them on the same line?  Ok, fine, I get it that FB wants to keep their questions short.  That I can live with.

What I can't live with is the inexplicable decision to truncate each option when there is plenty of room on the right to show the whole text.  The first option only has 4 more characters for goodness sake!  As it is, only 3 of the 5 options are displayed.  It gets worse from there...

Clicking on the "2 more" link opens this window:

<a href="http://mlprosper.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/screen-shot-2011-05-03-at-10-12-20-pm.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-88" title="Screen shot 2011-05-03 at 10.12.20 PM" src="http://mlprosper.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/screen-shot-2011-05-03-at-10-12-20-pm.png" alt="" width="500" height="396" /></a>

If I click on "2 more", doesn't that mean I would like to see 2 more options?  Why continue to obscure the last 2 choices when<em> I just clicked a link that says "2 more"</em>?

Even though the window is wider now, <em>the text of the choices is still truncated</em><strong>!  </strong>I can't even choose to expand the options - I have to hover my mouse over them to see the full text in a tooltip.  Madness!  As if other Facebook users don't have anything else to do but hunt and peck to read the options of my stupid little poll.

It gets even better if I try to edit:

<a href="http://mlprosper.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/screen-shot-2011-05-03-at-10-12-32-pm.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-87" title="Screen shot 2011-05-03 at 10.12.32 PM" src="http://mlprosper.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/screen-shot-2011-05-03-at-10-12-32-pm.png" alt="" width="500" height="384" /></a>

If I click on "Edit Options", doesn't that imply that I can, hmm.. say, EDIT the options?  Well, Facebook has decided that I can't <strong>EDIT</strong> the options, only delete them.  They also decided that I can't edit the question itself from this window.  I guess I have to delete and recreate the poll to do that.

Facebook, you get a big fat "F" for your Question tool.

It's a good start, but if I can point out these basic flaws in my first run through of the feature, they should have been caught in any kind of quality assurance process.   You can do better.

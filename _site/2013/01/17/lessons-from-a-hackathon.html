<div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I joined my entire engineering team (6 guys) at the <a href="http://dev.slcedu.org/blog/slc-camp-bay-area-silicon-valley-slc-education-innovation">Shared Learning Collaborative Camp</a> in the Bay Area, CA. Teams were tasked with creating a compelling education-focused application that used data from the SLC API. After 2 days of coding, we took 2nd place (out of 14) and won a nice $3k prize along with some Amazon Web Service credit. Looking back, we learned some important lessons:</p>

<h3>Go With What You Know</h3>

<p>Our final application ended up being a rat&#39;s nest of HTML/JS/CSS, VB.Net, C#, Webforms, JS libraries, compiled and dynamic code, and free MS services. Since our team skill set varied so widely, we didn&#39;t have time to pick a single stack and climb a learning curve. Everyone focused on what they were already good at and we made sure it all fit together at the end.</p>

<h3>Think Big And Start Small</h3>

<p>We figured we had about 8 hours of coding time before the first demo, then 3 hours of clean up before the final presentation. Not a lot of time. At the start of the day we brainstormed and came up with about 15 features we wanted to write in our messaging app. Nearly all of them ended up on the cutting room floor. We simply ran out of time and used only the simplest ideas. We made sure to rank the functionality ideas by priority so that we knew what to focus on and what to cut when push came to shove. </p>

<h3>Check Your Ego At the Door</h3>

<p>There&#39;s almost nothing worse than 2 smart engineers arguing about which technology is better. Dynamic or compiled? Python or Ruby? MySQL or Postgres? Honestly - no one cares. We used seemingly &quot;inferior technology&quot; in some parts of our app, but in the end no one cared in the demo.  Working with a team on a tight deadline doesn&#39;t leave much room for selfishness. We left a lot of code and ideas on the cutting room floor. We also didn&#39;t have much use for the back-end guys for the last few hours. It was nothing personal, so none of the team members took it as such.</p>

<h3>Have Fun</h3>

<p>The SLC Camp did a great job of keeping us fed, hydrated, and providing a comfortable place to work. None of us expected to win and didn&#39;t put any pressure on ourselves to perform. Sometimes it was hard to remember that all of us were on the same team when working late into the night and trying to resolve coding challenges. We tried to take breaks frequently, grab coffee, crack jokes, and generally have a great time. </p>

<p>Can&#39;t you tell we&#39;re having fun?!<br/>
